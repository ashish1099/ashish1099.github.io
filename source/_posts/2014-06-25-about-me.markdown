Hello, 

This is Ashish Jaiswal, the owner of this blog. I'm a Linux System Administrator. Just loving this whole "**Octopress + Github**". This is my first blog, I hope I can give something back to community. 

Just a basic intro about myself.

I have been working as a Linux Administrator from few past years. I'm currently focussing on configuration management and cloud computing, currently working at CMIE Pvt LTD.
